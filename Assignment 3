My masters research interests me around understanding decision making and unconscious bias while buying fast fashion 
that meet an individual’s wants over needs. Fast Fashion has becomes easy and cheap at the cost of the environment. 
I’m interested to empower small businesses and craft clusters working in silos to connect them with consumers, 
making consumers understand materials and their benefits if any, while they make a purchase. 

For my thesis project, I am looking at reducing fast fashion waste and designing a curriculum for high school teenagers, 
who are planning to pursue fashion careers so they learn basics of sustainable fashion at early stage. 
Data and computation would allow me to explore different possibilities of material knowledge and fabric decomposition 
that would help me to teach kids to build material vocabulary. It would also make it easier for me to visualize to 
share stories on social media to get peoples’ opinions and bring awareness about fast fashion. 

I have always been interested in coding. Interactive mediums and website have always made me curious and wanted to explore 
what happens behind it. I am interested in learning, collecting data and crafting connection, visualize to tell a story, 
now and as I work on future projects.
